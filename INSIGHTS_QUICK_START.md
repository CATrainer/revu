# "What's Working" Insights - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 5 Minutes

This guide will help you test the complete "What's Working" insights feature end-to-end.

## Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

This creates the new tables:
- `content_pieces` - Social media content
- `content_performance` - Performance metrics
- `content_insights` - AI-generated insights
- `content_themes` - Theme aggregates
- `action_plans` - Goal tracking
- `action_items` - Individual tasks

## Step 2: Start the Services

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```

### Demo Simulator (if using demo mode)
```bash
cd demo-simulator
python run.py
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Step 3: Enable Demo Mode & Generate Content

### Option A: Via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/demo/enable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "profile_type": "auto",
    "niche": "tech_reviews",
    "yt_subscribers": 100000,
    "ig_followers": 50000,
    "tt_followers": 200000
  }'
```

### Option B: Via Frontend
1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Demo Mode
2. Click "Enable Demo Mode"
3. Select your niche and preferences

The simulator will automatically generate 30-50 realistic content pieces with:
- Performance metrics
- AI-generated insights
- Theme categorization
- Realistic distribution (20% top, 60% normal, 20% poor)

## Step 4: Explore the Dashboard

### Main Insights Dashboard
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/insights`

**What you'll see:**
- **Summary Cards**: Total content, avg engagement, total views, performance distribution
- **Top Performers Tab**: Your 5 best pieces with AI insights explaining why they worked
- **Needs Attention Tab**: Underperforming content with improvement suggestions
- **Themes Tab**: Performance breakdown by content category
- **Platform Comparison**: YouTube vs Instagram vs TikTok performance

### Filters
- **Time Period**: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days
- **Platform**: All, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok

## Step 5: View Content Details

Click on any content piece to see:

1. **Full Performance Metrics**
   - Views, likes, comments, shares
   - Engagement rate, retention rate
   - Followers gained, profile visits

2. **Performance Score**
   - 0-100 score relative to your content
   - Percentile ranking

3. **AI Insights - "Why It Worked"**
   - High/medium/low impact factors
   - Timing analysis
   - Theme performance
   - Engagement quality

4. **Areas for Improvement**
   - Factors that limited performance
   - Specific recommendations

## Step 6: Interact with AI

Click **"Make More Like This"** or **"Diagnose with AI"** to:

1. Open AI chat with pre-loaded context about the content
2. Ask specific questions like:
   - "What made this video perform so well?"
   - "How can I replicate this success?"
   - "What should I post next?"

3. Get data-driven recommendations
4. Create action plans from conversations

## Step 7: Create an Action Plan

### From AI Chat
During conversation, the AI will suggest action plans. Example:

**AI**: "Based on this analysis, I recommend:
1. Post similar tutorial content on Thursdays at 2pm
2. Create 4 videos in the next month
3. Focus on 5-8 minute duration

Would you like me to create an action plan to track this?"

**You**: "Yes, create the plan"

### Manually
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/action-plans`

Click **"New Action Plan"**

## Step 8: Track Your Progress

In the Action Plans page:

1. **View Active Plans**
   - See progress bars
   - Check upcoming due dates
   - View completion status

2. **Complete Action Items**
   - Click checkboxes to mark tasks done
   - Add actual outcomes
   - Link to content you created

3. **Track Results**
   - Compare projected vs actual outcomes
   - Mark plans as complete
   - Review what worked

## Complete User Flow Example

```
1. User opens /dashboard/insights
   â†“
2. Sees "10 minute tutorial on React Hooks" performed amazingly
   â†“
3. Clicks to view full details
   â†“

## Expected Performance

With simulated data, you should see:

**Distribution**
- ~6 overperforming pieces (20%)
- ~20 normal pieces (60%)
- ~6 underperforming pieces (20%)

**Insights**
- 3-5 insights per top performer
- 2-3 insights per underperformer
- Mix of timing, theme, engagement, retention factors

**Themes**
- Tutorial content: highest performance
- Tips & Tricks: high engagement
- Vlogs: lower performance
- Reviews: moderate performance

**Platform Trends**
- YouTube: Higher retention rates
- Instagram: Higher engagement rates
- TikTok: Higher volume, shorter duration

## Troubleshooting

### No data showing
```bash
# Check if content was created
psql -d your_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_pieces;"

# If 0, regenerate content via demo mode
```

### Insights not displaying
```bash
# Check insights exist
psql -d your_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_insights;"

# Should have 3-5 per overperforming piece
```

### Action plans not updating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoints return 200
- Ensure WebSocket connections if using real-time

## Next Steps

Once you've tested with simulated data:

1. **Connect Real APIs**
   - Integrate YouTube Data API
   - Connect Instagram Graph API
   - Add TikTok API

2. **Automate Sync**
   - Set up Celery tasks to fetch new content
   - Update metrics daily
   - Regenerate insights periodically

3. **Enhance AI**
   - Add more sophisticated insight generation
   - Implement predictive analytics
   - Create automated action plans

4. **User Feedback**
   - Collect feedback on insights accuracy
   - A/B test different recommendation strategies
   - Refine scoring algorithms
