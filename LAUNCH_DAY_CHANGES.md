# Launch Day Changes - Repruv

## Overview
All changes have been implemented to prepare Repruv for public launch. This document summarizes the modifications made across backend and frontend.

---

## 1. Database Migration Script

**File Created**: `backend/upgrade_waitlist_users.py`

**Purpose**: Upgrade all existing waiting list users to full access

**Usage**:
```bash
cd backend
python upgrade_waitlist_users.py --list     # View all users by status
python upgrade_waitlist_users.py --upgrade  # Upgrade waiting list users
```

**What it does**:
- Lists all users grouped by access status
- Upgrades users with `access_status` of "waiting" or "waiting_list" to "full"
- Sets `early_access_granted_at` timestamp
- Provides confirmation prompt before making changes

**Action Required**: Run this script before deploying to upgrade existing waiting list users.

---

## 2. Signup Flow Updates

**File Modified**: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`

### Changes to `/signup` endpoint:

**Old Behavior**:
- New signups were added to waiting list
- Set `access_status = "waiting"`
- Users had to wait for manual approval

**New Behavior**:
- **Immediate full access** for all new signups
- Set `access_status = "full"` automatically
- Set `early_access_granted_at = datetime.utcnow()`
- **Merges waiting list users**: If email already exists with waiting list status, upgrades them to full access
- Sets password and full name if previously only had email

**Key Logic**:
```python
if existing_user and existing_user.access_status in ["waiting", "waiting_list"]:
    # Upgrade to full access
    existing_user.access_status = "full"
    existing_user.has_account = True
    existing_user.early_access_granted_at = datetime.utcnow()
else:
    # Create new user with full access
    user.access_status = "full"
    user.has_account = True
```

## Database Queries for Launch

### Count users by status
```sql
SELECT access_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
GROUP BY access_status;
```

### View all waiting list users (before migration)
```sql
SELECT id, email, full_name, joined_waiting_list_at, access_status
FROM users
WHERE access_status IN ('waiting', 'waiting_list')
ORDER BY joined_waiting_list_at;
```

### Verify upgrade completed
```sql
SELECT access_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
WHERE early_access_granted_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY access_status;
```

### View feedback submissions
```sql
SELECT 
    uf.id,
    u.email,
    uf.feedback_type,
    uf.title,
    uf.status,
    uf.created_at
FROM user_feedback uf
JOIN users u ON uf.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY uf.created_at DESC;
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If you need to revert changes:

**Backend**:
1. Revert `auth.py` to previous version (waiting list behavior)
2. Users created after deployment will have full access (keep them)
3. Stop accepting new signups temporarily if issues arise

**Frontend**:
1. Revert landing page changes (re-add email form)
2. Change CTAs back to "Get Early Access"
3. Restore Account/Billing tabs if needed

**Database**:
```sql
-- Revert specific users back to waiting (not recommended)
UPDATE users 
SET access_status = 'waiting'
WHERE early_access_granted_at > '2025-10-08 16:00:00'; -- adjust date
```

---

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### Metrics to Track

**User Signups**:
- Monitor new user registrations
- Check access_status distribution
- Verify no users stuck in "waiting" status

**Feedback System**:
- Review feedback submissions daily
- Prioritize bug reports
- Track feature requests for roadmap

**System Health**:
- Monitor API response times on `/auth/signup`
- Check database connections
- Watch for errors in feedback submission

### Support Queries

**If user reports signup issues**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

**If feedback not appearing**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_feedback WHERE user_id = <user_id> ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
