## Initial Email

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Managing creator talent means drowning in comments, DMs, and analytics across multiple platforms. Your team spends hours on tasks that don't scale.

We built Repruv to fix that.

**What your creators get:**
- AI-powered comment & DM responses (YouTube + Instagram)
- Cross-platform analytics in one dashboard
- Monetization tracking and revenue insights
- AI assistant trained on their content style

**What your agency gets:**
- Centralized creator management dashboard
- Campaign tracking and pipeline visibility
- Finance and earnings overview across all talent
- Team collaboration tools

**The measurable outcome:** Agencies in our pilot are seeing creators respond to 3x more fan engagement while spending 60% less time on community management.

We're onboarding 3-5 agency partners for Early Access — free access during development, direct input on features, and 30-40% off locked in permanently.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits {{companyName}}?

Best,
{{senderFirstName}}

P.S. Your creators can try the dashboard free today at repruv.co.uk — no commitment, just results.

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick follow-up — wanted to share what one agency told us:

"We used to have a VA spending 15 hours/week just managing YouTube comments across our roster. Repruv handles that automatically now."

If creator engagement and monetization tracking is on your radar, happy to show you how it works in 15 minutes.

Last note — we're closing Early Access partner spots this month.

If timing's bad, no worries. But if you're curious: repruv.co.uk/agency-partners
