# Interactions V2: Production-Ready Redesign

**Started:** 2025-01-07 20:07:00  
**Goal:** Make interactions system cohesive and production-ready  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS

---

## 🎯 Core Problems Being Solved

1. ❌ Views and workflows feel disconnected
2. ❌ No clear path from viewing → responding
3. ❌ Approval queue separate from main view
4. ❌ Can't filter/sort within a view dynamically
5. ❌ No interaction detail panel for context

---

## ✅ Design Principles

1. **Simple UI** - Everything accessible from one place
2. **Great Function** - Views, workflows, approvals integrated
3. **Clear Flow** - View → Filter → Interact → Respond
4. **Context-Rich** - Show video, platform, thread history
5. **Flexible** - Dynamic filtering without changing view definition

- [x] Add `pending_response` JSONB field (stores AI-generated responses)
- [x] Add `responded_at` timestamp
- [x] Add index on `status` for fast filtering
- [x] Create migration file (20250107_2010_enhance_interactions_for_v2.py)

#### API Enhancements
- [x] Update GET /interactions endpoint to support `status` filter
- [x] Add `tab` parameter (all, unanswered, awaiting_approval, answered)

- [x] Support temporary platform filtering - already existed
- [x] Add GET /interactions/{id}/thread endpoint (get full thread)

- [x] Update schemas for new fields

#### New Endpoints
- [x] POST /interactions/{id}/generate-response (AI response with Claude)

#### Workflow Triggers
- [ ] When workflow generates response:
  - [ ] Set `pending_response` field
  - [ ] Set `status` = 'awaiting_approval'

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] `/` - Focus search
- [ ] `Esc` - Close detail panel
- [ ] `Cmd+Enter` - Send response
- [ ] `↑↓` - Navigate interactions

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Detail Panel:** Slide-in from right (better than modal for desktop)
- **Tabs:** Horizontal at top of view (familiar pattern)
- **Status Field:** Enum for consistency
- **Pending Response:** JSONB to store AI metadata

### Technical Considerations
- Use optimistic updates for instant feedback
- Cache interaction details to avoid re-fetching
- Debounce search/filter changes
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists
