# Migration Complete: /comments → /interactions

**Completed:** 2025-01-07 01:05 AM  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

---

## 🎉 What We Accomplished

Successfully consolidated the **old `/comments` system** with the **new `/interactions` system** into a unified, modern interaction management platform.

---

## 📊 Changes Made

### **1. Workflow Pages Migrated**

Moved 4 workflow pages from `/comments/workflows/*` to `/interactions/workflows/*`:

```
✅ /interactions/workflows (main hub - 123 lines)
✅ /interactions/workflows/active (manage workflows - 101 lines)
✅ /interactions/workflows/approvals (approval queue - 294 lines)
✅ /interactions/workflows/create (creation wizard - copied with path updates)
```

**All internal links updated:**
- `href="/comments/workflows"` → `href="/interactions/workflows"`
- Back buttons, navigation links, form actions all updated

---

### **2. Created Redirect at /comments**

Old `/comments` page now redirects to `/interactions`:

```typescript
export default function CommentsRedirectPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  useEffect(() => {
    router.replace('/interactions');
  }, [router]);
  // Shows loading spinner during redirect
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Existing bookmarks still work
- Smooth user transition
- No broken links
- Can remove old code later

---

### **3. Updated Navigation**

**Interactions Sidebar:**
- Added "Workflows" link in footer
- Points to `/interactions/workflows`
- Alongside "Analytics" link

**Result:** Users can access workflows directly from interactions page.

---

## 🎯 New Unified Structure

```
/interactions (NEW MAIN HUB)
├── Main page with custom views
├── ViewSidebar with pinned/unpinned views
├── InteractionList with bulk actions
├── ViewBuilder modal
│
├── /workflows (MIGRATED FROM /comments)
│   ├── Main workflows hub
│   ├── /active (manage active workflows)
│   ├── /approvals (approval queue)
│   └── /create (workflow wizard)
│
├── /fans (Fan CRM - ready to build)
└── /analytics (Future)

/comments → REDIRECTS to /interactions
```
