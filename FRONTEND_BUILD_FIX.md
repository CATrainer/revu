# Frontend Build Fix

## 🚨 Problem
```
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path.
Please check /(dashboard)/profile/page and /profile/page.
```

**Cause:** Two profile pages existed:
1. `app/profile/page.tsx` - Old placeholder
2. `app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx` - New complete profile page

Both resolved to `/profile` route, causing a conflict.

## ✅ Solution

**Deleted:** `app/profile/page.tsx` (old placeholder)

**Kept:** `app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx` (new complete version with all features)

## 📁 What Was Removed

```
frontend/app/profile/
  └── page.tsx  (placeholder - only had "Coming soon" message)
```

## 📁 What Remains

```
frontend/app/(dashboard)/profile/
  └── page.tsx  (complete profile management with photo upload, forms, etc.)
```

## ✅ Result

- ✅ Build now succeeds
- ✅ No route conflicts
- ✅ Profile page accessible at `/profile` within dashboard
- ✅ Full-featured profile management available

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

The frontend will now build successfully in Vercel.
