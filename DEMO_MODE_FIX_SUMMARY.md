# Demo Mode Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong

1. ✅ **All backend code was correct** - API endpoints, models, tasks all working
2. ✅ **All frontend code existed** - Settings page at `/settings/demo-mode`
3. ❌ **No visual indicator** - Users couldn't see if demo mode was active
4. ❌ **No onboarding prompt** - Users didn't know demo mode existed
5. ❓ **Env vars may not be set** - `DEMO_SERVICE_URL` might be missing in Railway

**Root Cause**: You haven't enabled demo mode yet! The Celery logs show "No content needing comments" because no DemoProfile exists in the database.

---

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Added Demo Mode Banner to Dashboard** ✅

When demo mode is active, you'll now see:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ● Demo Mode Active                                    ║
║   Using simulated data from tech reviews.             ║
║   Interactions will arrive shortly.        [Manage]   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### 2. **Added Onboarding Prompt** ✅

When you have NO interactions, you'll see:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ✨ No interactions yet?                                ║
║   Try Demo Mode to see how Repruv works              ║
║                               [Enable Demo Mode]      ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### 3. **Created Setup Documentation** ✅

See `docs/DEMO_MODE_SETUP.md` for complete configuration guide.

### 4. **Updated .env.example** ✅

Added required demo service configuration.

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Railway

**Backend Service**:
```bash
railway variables --service backend set \
  DEMO_SERVICE_URL=https://demo-simulator-production.up.railway.app \
  DEMO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

**Demo-Simulator Service**:
```bash
# Copy the same webhook secret from above
railway variables --service demo-simulator set \
  MAIN_APP_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api/v1 \
  MAIN_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<paste-the-secret-from-above>
```

### Step 2: Deploy Changes

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(demo): Add visual indicators and setup docs"
git push
```

Railway will auto-deploy both services.

### Step 3: Enable Demo Mode

1. Navigate to **your deployed frontend** (Vercel)
2. Go to `/settings/demo-mode`
3. Select a niche (e.g., "Tech Reviews")
4. Choose profile size (Medium Creator recommended)
5. Click **"Enable Demo Mode"**

### Step 4: Wait 1-2 Minutes

The system will:
1. Create your DemoProfile
2. Generate 3 initial videos
3. Start generating comments every 5 minutes
4. Send interactions to your dashboard every 1 minute

### Step 5: Check Results

1. Go to `/dashboard` - You should see the purple demo mode banner
2. Go to `/interactions` - Interactions should start appearing
3. Check Railway logs if nothing appears after 5 minutes

## Expected Timeline

| Time | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| T+0s | Click "Enable Demo Mode" |
| T+5s | DemoProfile created, 3 videos generated |
| T+5min | First batch of comments generated (10-30 comments) |
| T+6min | Comments sent via webhook to backend |
| T+6min | Interactions appear in `/interactions` feed |
| T+10min | More comments arrive |
| T+30min | First DMs arrive |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Demo Mode Not Enabling

**Check**:
```bash
# Backend logs
railway logs --service backend | grep -i demo

# Demo-simulator logs  
railway logs --service demo-simulator
```

**Common Issues**:
- `DEMO_SERVICE_URL` not set → Backend can't reach demo-simulator
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` missing in demo-simulator → Content generation fails
- Different webhook secrets → Webhooks rejected

### No Interactions After 5 Minutes

**Check Celery Logs**:
```bash
railway logs --service demo-simulator | grep -i "comment\|interaction"
```

**Should See**:
```
[INFO] Generated 15 comments for Tech Reviews: Best Laptops...
[INFO] Sent 15 interactions, 0 failed
```

**If You See**:
```
[INFO] No content needing comments
```
→ DemoProfile not created. Check backend logs for errors during `/demo/enable`

## Current Status Checklist

Before asking for help, verify:

- [ ] `DEMO_SERVICE_URL` set in backend Railway service
- [ ] `DEMO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set in backend Railway service
- [ ] `MAIN_APP_URL` set in demo-simulator Railway service
- [ ] `MAIN_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set in demo-simulator Railway service
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in demo-simulator Railway service
- [ ] Both services deployed and running
- [ ] Visited `/settings/demo-mode` in deployed frontend
- [ ] Clicked "Enable Demo Mode" button
- [ ] Waited at least 5 minutes
- [ ] Checked Railway logs for both services

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check if demo mode enabled for your user
railway run --service backend psql $DATABASE_URL -c \
  "SELECT email, demo_mode FROM users WHERE email='your@email.com';"

# Check if DemoProfile exists
railway run --service demo-simulator psql $DATABASE_URL -c \
  "SELECT * FROM demo_profiles WHERE is_active=true;"

# Check pending interactions
railway run --service demo-simulator psql $DATABASE_URL -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM demo_interactions WHERE status='pending';"
```

---

## Success Looks Like

1. **Dashboard**: Purple banner showing "Demo Mode Active"
2. **Interactions Page**: Comments and DMs appearing every minute
3. **Celery Logs**: "Sent X interactions, 0 failed" every minute
4. **Database**: `user.demo_mode = true` in main DB
5. **Database**: Active DemoProfile in demo-simulator DB

## Files Modified

- `frontend/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added demo mode indicators
- `backend/.env.example` - Added demo service config
- `docs/DEMO_MODE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `demo-simulator/app/models/demo_content.py` - Fixed Boolean type (already done)

No breaking changes. Safe to deploy immediately.
