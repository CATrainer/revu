## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 - Backend Integration
When ready to connect to real AI engine:
1. Replace JSON imports with API calls to backend
2. Add loading states while fetching opportunities
3. Implement real-time opportunity generation based on user data
4. Add opportunity favoriting/bookmarking
5. Track implementation progress in database

### Potential Features
- Save opportunity progress to user account
- Share opportunities with team members
- Export implementation plan as PDF
- Set reminders for implementation milestones
- Connect opportunities to analytics (track which ones were implemented)
- A/B test different opportunity presentations
- Personalized AI insights based on user's platform connections

## 📝 Notes

- **This is NOT demo mode**: Completely separate from YouTube connection demo
- **Hardcoded data**: All 30 opportunities are static JSON files
- **Production-ready UI**: Polished animations and interactions
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support throughout
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation, proper ARIA labels
- **Responsive**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes
- **Theme support**: Works with both light and dark modes

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Data is static (will be resolved when backend integration happens)
- No user progress persistence (will add when connected to database)
- No opportunity filtering or search (can add if needed)
- No export functionality (can add PDF export)

## 🎉 Success Criteria
