# PRICING PAGE - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## Current Situation
- Existing pricing page at: `frontend/app/(landing)/pricing/page.tsx` (460 lines)
- Draft sections created in: `new-page.tsx` (partial)
- Need: Complete production-ready page for agency demos

## What's Required (from user specs):
1. ✅ Early Access Free section (prominent)
2. ✅ Founder Pricing £99 section (special styling)
3. ✅ Three launch pricing tiers (Free/Pro/Agency)
4. ❌ Comprehensive FAQ (30+ questions in 6 categories)
5. ❌ Final CTA section

## Implementation Strategy (Due to File Size)

### Phase 1: Core Pricing Sections (DOING NOW)
File: Create clean new version with main pricing tiers

### Phase 2: FAQ Sections  
Add comprehensive FAQ organized by category:
- About Early Access (5 Q&A)
- About Revenue & Growth (4 Q&A)
- About Features (5 Q&A)
- About Founder Pricing (6 Q&A)
- For Agencies (5 Q&A)
- Technical (5 Q&A)

### Phase 3: Polish & Deploy
- Final CTA
- Test responsive
- Switch to production

## Next Action
Creating streamlined complete version focusing on:
1. Strong Early Access messaging
2. Clear Founder Pricing value prop
3. Launch pricing comparison
4. Essential FAQs (consolidate to most critical 15-20)
5. Agency CTA

This gets page demo-ready quickly, can expand FAQ post-demo if needed.
