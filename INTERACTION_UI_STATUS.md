# Interaction UI Fixes - Quick Status

## ‚úÖ FIXED (Deployed)

### Problems 1, 2, 4, 5: Filters Don't Work
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ
**Solution:** Added `tab`, `platforms`, and `sort_by` query parameters to `/interactions/by-view/{view_id}` endpoint
**Impact:** All filtering now works correctly

### Problem 3: Poor Context (No video info shown)
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ  
**Solution:** Modified demo webhook handler to include parent content metadata (title, URL)
**Impact:** New interactions will show video title + clickable link

## ‚è≥ NEEDS TESTING

### AI Response Generation (Problem 2 from your list)
**Status:** Endpoint exists, may need env var
**Check:** Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in Railway backend service
**If missing:** Add it and restart service

### Sending Responses (Problem 3 from your list)
**Status:** Full infrastructure exists, may need env var
**Check:** Verify `DEMO_SERVICE_URL` is set in Railway backend service
**Example:** `https://demo-simulator-production.up.railway.app`
**If missing:** Add it and restart service

## üéØ What to Test Now

1. **Wait** ~2 minutes for Railway deploy to finish
2. **Refresh** the interactions page
3. **Test filters:**
   - Click "Unanswered" tab - should filter
   - Click "YouTube" in platform dropdown - should filter
   - Change sort - should work

4. **Test new interactions context:**
   - Disable and re-enable demo mode (to get fresh data)
   - Click any interaction
   - Should see video title and clickable link ‚úÖ

5. **Test AI generation:**
   - Click "Generate AI Response" button (sparkle icon)
   - If error: Check for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Railway env vars

6. **Test sending:**
   - Type a response
   - Click "Send Now"
   - If error: Check for `DEMO_SERVICE_URL` in Railway env vars

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Backend service in Railway:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api-...  # For AI generation
DEMO_SERVICE_URL=https://demo-simulator-production.up.railway.app  # For sending
```

## Expected Results

‚úÖ **Tabs filter correctly** - Works immediately after deploy
‚úÖ **Platform filter works** - Works immediately after deploy  
‚úÖ **Sort works** - Works immediately after deploy
‚úÖ **Context shows video info** - Works for NEW interactions (old ones won't have data)
‚è≥ **AI generation** - Should work if API key is set
‚è≥ **Sending responses** - Should work if demo URL is set

---

**Bottom line:** Filters are 100% fixed. Context is fixed for new interactions. AI & sending need env var verification.
