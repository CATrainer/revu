## Sample Outreach Templates

### LinkedIn Message:
> "Hi [Name], I noticed [Restaurant] has 42 unanswered Google reviews from the last 3 months. Each unaddressed negative review costs an average of £1,500 in lost revenue. I'm launching a tool that fixes this - interested in being one of our founding members at 50% off?"

### Email Subject Lines:
- "Your competitor just responded to 50 reviews yesterday"
- "[Restaurant name] is leaving money on the table"
- "I analyzed your Google reviews - concerning trend"

### The Close:
> "Look, I know you're busy running your business. That's exactly why I built this. For £100/month - about the cost of 2 covers - you never have to think about reviews again. Your responses go out professionally, on-brand, within hours. Should we get you set up as a founding member?"
